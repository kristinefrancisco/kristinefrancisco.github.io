Title: Cat Ghost
Subhed: Posessing all things cute and delicious.

//

In a nutshell: A cat ghost that turns into the things he's fed - a la Kirby.

Intro: Like most people I find solace in all cute things, and unlike 
most people I also find solace in the macabre. I'd been working on this 
character a few months ago with the hopes of building a some sort of game app,
but it got pushed to the backburner. Ready to bring him back to life/death.

Elements:
- Cat Ghost imgs (OG Cat Ghost + Cat Ghost as the food he's given)
- 5 food item imgs

Interaction:
- Base animations for imgs (floating Cat Ghost and food, etc.)
- Drag food to Cat Ghost
- Cat Ghost poofing or pixelating into respective food item + food pun phrase popping up
- "Purge" button to revert him back to normal?
