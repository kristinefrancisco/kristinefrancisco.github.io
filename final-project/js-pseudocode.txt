Using Jquery & JqueryUI:

- find draggable object with mouse
- designate droppable zone
- drop draggable object into droppable zone = drop zone is highlighted (through animation/static color)
- draggable disappears into drop zone
- drop zone image changes according to specific draggable object dropped in (if/else if statements?)
